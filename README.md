# Improving Sound Source Localization with Joint Slot Attention on Image and Audio

Official implementation of **"Improving Sound Source Localization with Joint Slot Attention on Image and Audio"**.

[PAPER](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15118)

## Features

- **Slot Attention Mechanism**: Decomposes audio-visual features into discrete slots representing different sound sources
- **Multi-Modal Learning**: Combines visual (ResNet) and audio encoders for joint representation learning
- **Multiple Evaluation Metrics**: Supports cIoU, AUC, and mAP for comprehensive performance assessment
- **Flexible Training**: Supports multiple datasets and training configurations

## Architecture

- **Visual Encoder**: ResNet-based image feature extractor
- **Audio Encoder**: ResNet-based spectrogram feature extractor
- **Slot Attention Module**: Iterative attention mechanism for object-centric representations
- **Object Saliency Integration**: Combines learned features with object saliency maps

## Supported Datasets

- **VGG-Sound**: 10k and 144k training splits
- **Flickr SoundNet**: 10k and 144k training splits
- **AVSBench**: MS3 and S4 test sets for evaluation

## Training

Use the provided shell script for training:

```bash
# Train on VGG-Sound 10k dataset, test on VGG-Sound
bash train_script.sh vggss_10k vggss 0

# Train on Flickr 10k dataset, test on Flickr
bash train_script.sh flickr_10k flickr 0 experiment_name

# Train on VGG-Sound 144k dataset
bash train_script.sh vggss_144k vggss 0
```

### Training Parameters

- `$1`: Training dataset (vggss_10k, vggss_144k, flickr_10k, flickr_144k)
- `$2`: Test dataset (vggss, vggss_heard, vggss_unheard, flickr, ms3, s4, all)
- `$3`: GPU device ID
- `$4`: Experiment name (optional)

### Key Hyperparameters

## Testing

Use the provided shell script for testing:

```bash
# Test on VGG-Sound test set
bash test_script.sh vggss 0 your_experiment
```

### Testing Parameters

- `$1`: Test dataset (vggss, vggss_heard, vggss_unheard, flickr, ms3, s4)
- `$2`: GPU device ID
- `$3`: Experiment name (should match the checkpoint directory name)

## Logging

Training progress is logged using Weights & Biases (wandb). Set `--wandb true` to enable online logging.

## Dataset Preparation

Update the dataset paths in `train_script.sh` and `test_script.sh`:

```bash
# For VGG-Sound
train_path="/path/to/VGGSound/"
test_data_path="/path/to/VGGSound/"
test_gt_path="metadata/vggss.json"

# For Flickr
train_path="/path/to/flickr_trainset/"
test_data_path="/path/to/Flickr/test/"
test_gt_path="/path/to/Flickr/test/Annotations/"
```
